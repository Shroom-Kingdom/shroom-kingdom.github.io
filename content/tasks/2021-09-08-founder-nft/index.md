We just recently announced our upcoming [NFT Airdrop](@/blog/2021-09-06-nft-airdrop.md).

It will be possible for participants of the Airdrop to acquire a special Founder NFT,
which can be displayed in our [web application](https://app.shroomkingdom.net/).
The NFT will also unlock [NEAR chan](https://near-chan.github.io/) as a playable character.
