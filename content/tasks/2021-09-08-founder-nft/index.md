The NFT will need a unique art style, that represents our platform. \

The NFT art should include elements from the game series we all know, \

The art can either be in portrait or landscape mode.

We just recently announced our upcoming [NFT Airdrop](@/blog/2021-09-06-nft-airdrop.md).

It will be possible for participants of the Airdrop to acquire a special Founder NFT,
which can be displayed in our [web application](https://app.shroomkingdom.net/).
The NFT will also unlock [NEAR chan](https://near-chan.github.io/) as a playable character.
All artwork should be submitted either as PNG or losless WebP.
