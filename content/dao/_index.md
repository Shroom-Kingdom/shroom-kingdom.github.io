# Decentralised Autonomous Organization

The Shroom Kingdom DAO is the organization that manages the project and should one day make it completely
community owned.
The longer the project exists, the more members will be added to the council,
which will do decisions based on the project.
To learn more about the DAO, you should read the [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.shroomkingdom.net/8_DAO.html).

Members of the DAO or temporary supporters of the project will be able to receive payouts via
[Sputnik DAO](https://v2.sputnik.fund/#/shrm.sputnik-dao.near),
that will be approved by the council or specific members of it.
Applications to join the DAO can be made on Shroom Kingdom's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/SPZsgSe).

This section of the website will be updated regularly with open positions and tasks.
