description = """\
Starting his career as a software engineer in 2017 with a focus on frontend development, \
Mario soon became an early adopter of WebAssembly as a technology. \
This is also how he found out about Rust, which became his favorite programming language.<br/>\
WebAssembly is also what brought him to Web3, when he found out that you can use it to develop Smart Contracts. \
These technological features made him decide to build Shroom Kingdom on NEAR Protocol.
